Joshua Chang, M.D., Ph.D., is an assistant professor in the Department of Neurology and a courtesy assistant professor in the Department of Population Health.

Chang completed his Bachelor of Science and his Master of Engineering degrees at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in electrical engineering and computer science, focusing on signal processing and artificial intelligence. His master’s dissertation was completed at the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in missile tracking using different radar modalities.

Before pursuing an M.D./Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, he worked as a software engineer at the Broad Institute and Harvard’s School of Public Health and Center for Health Decision Science. At UMass, he completed a thesis in quantitative health sciences and neurology under the supervision and mentorship of David Paydarfar, designing and developing adaptive control algorithms to optimize stimulus waveforms for implantable medical devices. He continues his research at Dell Medical School, studying ways to leverage artificial intelligence to better improve population health through health care across diagnostics, therapeutics and predictive analytics.
