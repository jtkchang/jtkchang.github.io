Welcome to our lab!  We are interested in bringing computational tools and techniques to bear in healthcare, whether that is at the cellular level, developing algorithms for optimizing stimulus waveforms for electroceutical devices or at the community level, examining optimal transportation strategies for emergency services in a local region for stroke care.  Not only are we interested in optimizing various treatments and strategies, but we are very interested in these optimization approaches through improved understanding of the underlying physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms.  Check out our <a html="projects.html"> Projects </a> page to learn more about what we're doing.
