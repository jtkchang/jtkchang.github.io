### Description
Among emergency transport services, there have been a number of interesting questions arising from the optimal transport strategy for patients suspected of having a stroke. These questions arise due to the fact that time is brain. The longer it takes for a stroke victim to be reperfused, the more brain matter is lost. In partnership with Austin EMS and the Seton hospital network in Austin, we have been examining both from a data-driven approach, as well as developing our own physiologically-driven model, the different transport strategies and their impact in Travis County. Our goal is to be able to provide insights for public health and policy officials regarding how to optimize transport strategies as well as the cost-effectiveness of various proposed improvements to the local stroke care network (including mobile stroke units and upgrading hospital certifications).
